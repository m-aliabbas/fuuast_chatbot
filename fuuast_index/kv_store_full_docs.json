Currently, it is one of the leading departments in the field of Economics in terms of PhD faculty strength, diversity of offered courses, and research publications. The Department of Economics at FUUAST was launched in spring 2004. It commenced its program with one full-time professor and a few visiting faculties, and since then it has blossomed into an excellent centre of economic learning. Since the launch of study programs in economics in 2004, 44 candidates have been awarded Ph.D. degrees, while 115 have been awarded M. Phil degrees. The graduates of the department have been successful in competing in job markets and holding their own against the alumni of well-established institutions of higher learning in the country. The Mission of the Department of Economics is to train graduates in economics who are well grounded in economic theory and its applications to real-life situations. The department is also publishing a peer-reviewed research journal. The Journal of Economic Sciences (JES), with E-ISSN 2958-0676 and P-SSN 2958-0668, is a biannual and open-access journal. It aims to encourage and promote original thinking in various fields of the economic sciences. The journal also offers a unique perspective on policy issues critical to developing economies around the world. It publishes original theoretical and empirical contributions in economics (all areas) and related fields. The department offers programs of study leading to B.S. Economics, BS Economics and Finance, M. Phil., and Ph.D. degrees in Economics. There are two associate professors and six assistant professors in the department and two lecturers.\nVision\nThe Department of Economics seeks to contribute to questions at the frontiers of economic knowledge by drawing on the economic and social life in economic research. The Department has 8 full-time PhD faculty members who are dedicated to teaching and conducting research in areas such as macroeconomics, microeconomics, econometrics, development, environment, trade, and finance. Our undergraduate programme provides with a comprehensive knowledge of theoretical and applied concepts in the economics and finance. We encourage to learn how to pose interesting economic questions and apply economic theory and empirical methods in solving problems. Students are able to choose from three major areas: Economics; Economics and Political Science; Economics and Mathematics. Our undergraduate students go on to build careers in government, policy making, law, education, and business, with many pursuing post-graduate degrees. The graduate programme is designed for fresh graduates as well as professionals seeking further training in Economics for career progression or change. We in MS and PhD Economics encourages you to apply your training to address and resolve major challenges in business and policy.\nMission\nEconomics to future leaders of industry, government and civil society\nThe department offers programs of studies leading to BS Economics (4 years), BS Economics and Finance (4 years), ADP in Economics and Economics and Finance (2 years), Third year program in Economics and Economics and Finance (2 years), M. Phil. and Ph.D Economics.\nObjectives\nThe Department of Economics aims to provide the curriculum and environment that fosters development of effective practitioners and scholars. The students are given training in economic and financial analysis, and statistical tools. They develop understanding of the financial markets and the financial instruments, and a broader perspective of the contemporary issues. The objective is to develop the skills, professional attitude, and competence required to design, evaluate and execute decisions, policies and strategies in todayâ€™s highly dynamic environment. The rigorous training provided by the Department has proved to be a solid foundation for individuals who have gone directly to the workforce in the financial services sector or business management, or consultancy, or decided to continue their education in graduate business and other professional fields.\nHoD Message\nAs the head of this excellent department, I have the great honor of having this chair. I've been a part of this community for fifteen years, and I must say that spending my life with such amazing individuals has been a true pleasure. I desire that FUUAST undergraduates learn how economics may be used to develop the world. I am glad that students who are interested in finance or management consulting have traditionally chosen to specialize in economics. Economics is for me or you if we want to learn about policies that affect the environment or end world poverty. Economics is for us if we're interested in learning what drives economic growth or inequality. The market economies support horrible forms of discrimination while also making technical miracles possible. Improving the global economy starts with understanding it. Making sure that every undergraduate has the chance to participate in authentic economic research is something I am quite passionate about. It is my goal that economic research will bring happiness to our graduate students. Finding a new fact or understanding a new idea is one of life's greatest joys. Additionally, keep in mind that humans are social animals that learn from being around other intelligent people. I am extremely appreciative of our partners, and the employees that make the department run smoothly. Their diffident expertise and good nature are invaluable in fostering a vibrant academic environment. Please let me know if there is any way that I can improve your lives. The FUUAST Department of Economics is a friendly and brilliant place. Many of the most important issues confronting humanity have answers that can be found in the study of economics. That's a belief I hold, and I hope you do too.\nFederal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology\nKuri Road Islamabad, 45570, Pakistan\nOffice# +92-9252861-64\nCopyright ©\n2024 \n            , designed & developed by\nIT Department\n\n--- FUUAST Islamabad ---\nFUUAST Islamabad\nannouncements\nJobs\nJournals\nSCHOLARSHIP\nmedia\nPlacement Bureau\nLogin\nHome\nPrograms\nGraduate\nUndergraduate\nFaculities\nArts\nDepartment of English\nDepartment of International Relations\nDepartment of Mass Communication\nDepartment of Urdu\nBusiness Administration, Commerce & Economics\nDepartment of Business Administration\nDepartment of Commerce\nDepartment of Economics\nEngineering\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\nMa'arif-e-Islamia\nDepartment of Islamic Studies\nScience & Technology\nDepartment of Physics\nDepartment of Computer Science\nDepartment of Mathematics\nDepartment of Sofware Engineering\nDepartment of Statistics\nStudents\nDigital Library\nExamination\nExamination\nDegree Clearance\nResults\nStatus Reports\nLaptop Scheme\nORIC\nUniversity Card\nDownload Forms\nAdmission\nApply Now\nMerit Lists\nAdministration\nAccounts\nFee Section\nAcademics\nAdmission Department\nIT Department\nIT Cell\nMIS Cell\nPlanning & Development\nQEC\nSecurity\nStore & Purchase\nTransport Section\nDownload Forms\nContact Us\nRegister\n×\nSIGN UP\nLogin\n×\nLOGIN\nIntroduction\nThe Examinations Department is one of the most important pillars of the University.

To develop an understanding of various literary genres and forms of expression (poetry, prose, novels, drama, non-fiction), as well as linguistic and rhetorical skills through frequent reading and writing assignments, class presentations and discussions, the emphasis is placed on the comprehensiveness and depth of the subjects covered. The Linguistic modules aim to provide an understanding of the historical, social, and psychological factors that shape the language used in everyday life, while the Literature modules are designed to foster interpretive skills applying to a wide range of genres and historical periods. We anticipate that this course of study, delivered by our incredibly passionate and skilled faculty members, will develop in students a love for reading, writing and research. To pursue this mission, the department aims at providing students the conducive academic environment where they can learn knowledge and relevant skills to excel in their professional life. The department also wants to focus on the character building and personality development of its students by involving them in different extra curricular activities so that they can become responsible citizens of their country and play a positive role in building a successful nation.\nObjectives\n1.

A team of well qualified, experienced, and motivated teachers is the hallmark of our department. We are fully committed to impart extensive theoretical and well as practical knowledge about English language and literature. We put special efforts in improving the English language proficiency of our students by engaging them in class discussion, presentations and reading-writing tasks. My personal mission is to see that every student of FUUAST department of English should have the ability to communicate effectively and use language as a tool for success both personally and professionally.\nI am proud to state that the department of English at FUUAST has pioneered in establishing co-curricular Clubs for students. Initially there are four clubs which are being led by the faculty: Dramatics & Debating Club, Reading & Writing Club, Seminar Club, Sports Club. Through these clubs we have created an exclusive space for students so that they can unleash their talent, explore their creativity, and learn outside the classroom. \nThe department strives to work for the overall growth and personality development of the students to inculcate qualities which are essential for building a just and peaceful society. In order to instill the spirit of volunteerism for community development, the department encourages and supports students to take initiatives for social causes. Turning our students into academically competent, professionally committed and socially responsible individuals is the prime aim of our department. \nI am confident that the graduates of our department will carve a niche for themselves in the academic and professional field of English language and literature.\nFederal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology\nKuri Road Islamabad, 45570, Pakistan\nOffice# +92-9252861-64\nCopyright ©\n2024 \n            , designed & developed by\nIT Department\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/AdMission/Elligibility%20Criteria%20Autumn%202024%20(Updated).pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/Commerce/BS%20(Commerce)%201st%20Semester%20Morning.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/QEC/Docs/Proforma%203.pdf ---\n\n\n--- FUUAST Islamabad ---\nFUUAST Islamabad\nannouncements\nJournals\nSCHOLARSHIP\nmedia\nLogin\nHome\nPrograms\nGraduate\nUndergraduate\nFaculities\nArts\nDepartment of English\nDepartment of International Relations\nDepartment of Mass Communication\nDepartment of Urdu\nBusiness Administration, Commerce & Economics\nDepartment of Business Administration\nDepartment of Commerce\nDepartment of Economics\nEngineering\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\nMa'arif-e-Islamia\nDepartment of Islamic Studies\nScience & Technology\nDepartment of Physics\nDepartment of Computer Science\nDepartment of Mathematics\nDepartment of Sofware Engineering\nDepartment of Statistics\nStudents\nDigital Library\nExamination\nExamination\nDegree Clearance\nResults\nStatus Reports\nLaptop Scheme\nORIC\nUniversity Card\nDownload Forms\nAdmission\nApply Now\nMerit Lists\nAdministration\nAccounts\nFee Section\nAcademics\nAdmission Department\nIT Department\nIT Cell\nMIS Cell\nPlanning & Development\nSecurity\nStore & Purchase\nTransport Section\nDownload Forms\nContact Us\nRegister\n×\nSIGN UP\nLogin\n×\nLOGIN\nDr. Anila Sultana\nPhD (Economics)\nAssistant Professor\nanilasultana@fuuast.edu.pk\nI dedicated my career to both research and teaching in this fascinating field.

I believe in creating an interactive and stimulating learning environment where we can explore complex concepts together, challenge assumptions, and apply theoretical frameworks to real-world scenarios.\nResearch Interests:\nDevelopment Economics\tClimate Change.\nGoogle Scholar\nORCID\nResearchGate\nResume/CV\nFederal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology\nKuri Road Islamabad, 45570, Pakistan\nOffice# +92-9252861-64\nCopyright ©\n2024 \n            , designed & developed by\nIT Department\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/MassCommunication/B.S%20(Mass%20Communication)%203rd%20Semester,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/Urdu/BS%20(Urdu)%205th.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ComputerScience/B.S%20(Computer%20Science)%201st%20Semester,%20Section%20-,%20Evening,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ElectricalEngineering/B.Sc.%20Electrical%20Engineering%20%20(Electroincs)%206th%20Semester,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Jobs/Instructions.pdf ---\n\n\n--- Economics ---\nEconomics\nannouncements\nJournals\nSCHOLARSHIP\nmedia\nLogin\nHome\nPrograms\nGraduate\nUndergraduate\nFaculty\nRegister\n×\nSIGN UP\nLogin\n×\nLOGIN\nUndergraduate Programs\nBS Economics\nThe main objective of BS program is to achieve the highest possible standards of education, teaching and research in economics.

So, with the consultation of qualified scholars, a research Journal of Islamic Studies was launched named “Al-Wifaq” to promote the research activities in the field of Islamic Studies in 2018.\nVisit Now\nFederal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology\nKuri Road Islamabad, 45570, Pakistan\nOffice# +92-9252861-64\nCopyright ©\n2024 \n            , designed & developed by\nIT Department\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ComputerScience/B.S%20(Computer%20Science)%205th%20Semester,%20Section%20A,%20Evening,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ComputerScience/B.S%20(Computer%20Science)%202nd%20Semester,%20Section%20A,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ComputerScience/B.S%20(Computer%20Science)%202nd%20Semester,%20Section%20B,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/SoftwareEngineering/BS%20Software%20Engineering%201st%20Semester,%20Section%20B,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- FUUAST Islamabad ---\nFUUAST Islamabad\nannouncements\nJournals\nSCHOLARSHIP\nmedia\nLogin\nHome\nPrograms\nGraduate\nUndergraduate\nFaculities\nArts\nDepartment of English\nDepartment of International Relations\nDepartment of Mass Communication\nDepartment of Urdu\nBusiness Administration, Commerce & Economics\nDepartment of Business Administration\nDepartment of Commerce\nDepartment of Economics\nEngineering\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\nMa'arif-e-Islamia\nDepartment of Islamic Studies\nScience & Technology\nDepartment of Physics\nDepartment of Computer Science\nDepartment of Mathematics\nDepartment of Sofware Engineering\nDepartment of Statistics\nStudents\nDigital Library\nExamination\nExamination\nDegree Clearance\nResults\nStatus Reports\nLaptop Scheme\nORIC\nUniversity Card\nDownload Forms\nAdmission\nApply Now\nMerit Lists\nAdministration\nAccounts\nFee Section\nAcademics\nAdmission Department\nIT Department\nIT Cell\nMIS Cell\nPlanning & Development\nSecurity\nStore & Purchase\nTransport Section\nDownload Forms\nContact Us\nRegister\n×\nSIGN UP\nLogin\n×\nLOGIN\nDr.\tTariq Mahmood\nPhD(Economics)\nAssistant Professor\nmahmoodtariq@fuuast.edu.pk\nWith 23 years of experience, Dr Mahmood has worked at the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Islamabad, since 2011.

Currently, it is one of the leading departments in the field of Economics in terms of PhD faculty strength, diversity of offered courses, and research publications. The Department of Economics at FUUAST was launched in spring 2004. It commenced its program with one full-time professor and a few visiting faculties, and since then it has blossomed into an excellent centre of economic learning. Since the launch of study programs in economics in 2004, 44 candidates have been awarded Ph.D. degrees, while 115 have been awarded M. Phil degrees. The graduates of the department have been successful in competing in job markets and holding their own against the alumni of well-established institutions of higher learning in the country. The Mission of the Department of Economics is to train graduates in economics who are well grounded in economic theory and its applications to real-life situations. The department is also publishing a peer-reviewed research journal. The Journal of Economic Sciences (JES), with E-ISSN 2958-0676 and P-SSN 2958-0668, is a biannual and open-access journal. It aims to encourage and promote original thinking in various fields of the economic sciences. The journal also offers a unique perspective on policy issues critical to developing economies around the world. It publishes original theoretical and empirical contributions in economics (all areas) and related fields. The department offers programs of study leading to B.S. Economics, BS Economics and Finance, M. Phil., and Ph.D. degrees in Economics. There are two associate professors and six assistant professors in the department and two lecturers.\nVision\nThe Department of Economics seeks to contribute to questions at the frontiers of economic knowledge by drawing on the economic and social life in economic research. The Department has 8 full-time PhD faculty members who are dedicated to teaching and conducting research in areas such as macroeconomics, microeconomics, econometrics, development, environment, trade, and finance. Our undergraduate programme provides with a comprehensive knowledge of theoretical and applied concepts in the economics and finance. We encourage to learn how to pose interesting economic questions and apply economic theory and empirical methods in solving problems. Students are able to choose from three major areas: Economics; Economics and Political Science; Economics and Mathematics. Our undergraduate students go on to build careers in government, policy making, law, education, and business, with many pursuing post-graduate degrees. The graduate programme is designed for fresh graduates as well as professionals seeking further training in Economics for career progression or change. We in MS and PhD Economics encourages you to apply your training to address and resolve major challenges in business and policy.\nMission\nEconomics to future leaders of industry, government and civil society\nThe department offers programs of studies leading to BS Economics (4 years), BS Economics and Finance (4 years), ADP in Economics and Economics and Finance (2 years), Third year program in Economics and Economics and Finance (2 years), M. Phil. and Ph.D Economics.\nObjectives\nThe Department of Economics aims to provide the curriculum and environment that fosters development of effective practitioners and scholars. The students are given training in economic and financial analysis, and statistical tools. They develop understanding of the financial markets and the financial instruments, and a broader perspective of the contemporary issues. The objective is to develop the skills, professional attitude, and competence required to design, evaluate and execute decisions, policies and strategies in todayâ€™s highly dynamic environment. The rigorous training provided by the Department has proved to be a solid foundation for individuals who have gone directly to the workforce in the financial services sector or business management, or consultancy, or decided to continue their education in graduate business and other professional fields.\nHoD Message\nAs the head of this excellent department, I have the great honor of having this chair. I've been a part of this community for fifteen years, and I must say that spending my life with such amazing individuals has been a true pleasure. I desire that FUUAST undergraduates learn how economics may be used to develop the world. I am glad that students who are interested in finance or management consulting have traditionally chosen to specialize in economics. Economics is for me or you if we want to learn about policies that affect the environment or end world poverty. Economics is for us if we're interested in learning what drives economic growth or inequality. The market economies support horrible forms of discrimination while also making technical miracles possible. Improving the global economy starts with understanding it. Making sure that every undergraduate has the chance to participate in authentic economic research is something I am quite passionate about. It is my goal that economic research will bring happiness to our graduate students. Finding a new fact or understanding a new idea is one of life's greatest joys. Additionally, keep in mind that humans are social animals that learn from being around other intelligent people. I am extremely appreciative of our partners, and the employees that make the department run smoothly. Their diffident expertise and good nature are invaluable in fostering a vibrant academic environment. Please let me know if there is any way that I can improve your lives. The FUUAST Department of Economics is a friendly and brilliant place. Many of the most important issues confronting humanity have answers that can be found in the study of economics. That's a belief I hold, and I hope you do too.\nFederal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology\nKuri Road Islamabad, 45570, Pakistan\nOffice# +92-9252861-64\nCopyright ©\n2024 \n            , designed & developed by\nIT Department\n\n--- Admission Add 9sep.jpeg (750×981) ---\nAdmission Add 9sep.jpeg (750×981)\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ComputerScience/B.S%20(Computer%20Science)%204th%20Semester,%20Section%20C,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/Results/Summer2024/ComputerScience/B.S%20(Computer%20Science)%206th%20Semester,%20Section%20A,%20Morning,%20Session%20Summer%202024.pdf ---\n\n\n--- Computer Science ---\nComputer Science\nannouncements\nJournals\nSCHOLARSHIP\nmedia\nLogin\nHome\nFaculty\nRegister\n×\nSIGN UP\nLogin\n×\nLOGIN\nFaculty of Computer Science\nDr. Muhammad Shiraz (HoD)\nPhD(CS)\nAssociate Professor\n✉\nmuhammad.shiraz@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nDr. Abdul Mateen\nPostDoc\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nabdulmateen@fuuastisb.edu.pk\nView Profile\nDr. Saeed Ullah\nPhD(CS)\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nsaeedullah@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nDr. Naveed Kazim Khan\nPhD(CS)\nAssistant Professor\nView Profile\nDr. Furqan Shahid\nPhD(CS)\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nfurqan.shahid@fuuastisb.edu.pk\nView Profile\nDr. Nauman Qadeer\nPhD(CS)\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nnauman.qadeer@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nDr. Kashif Rizwan\nPhD(CS)\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nkashifrizwan@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nMr. Muhammad Yousaf\nMS(CS)\nAssistant Professor\nView Profile\nMs. Fakhra Kashif\nMS(CS)\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nfakhra.kashif@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nDr. Faisal Baig\nPhD(EE)\nAssistant Professor\nView Profile\nDr. Yousaf Hameed\nPhD(EE)\nAssistant Professor\nView Profile\nDr. Ghawar Said\nPhD(CS)\nAssistant Professor\n✉\nghawarsaid@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMr. Naeem Akhtar Malik\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nfuuastnaeem@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMr. Khawaja Tahir Mehmood\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\nView Profile\nMs. Fazia Akhtar\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nfazia.akhtar@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nMr. Muhammad Jaffar Khan\nMS(EE)\nLecturer\n✉\njaffarkulachi@gmail.com.pk\nView Profile\nMr. Tahir Hussain\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\ntahir.hussain@fuuast.edu.pk\nView Profile\nMr. Muhammad Taseer ul Islam\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\ntaseerulislam@hotmail.com\nView Profile\nMs. Ateya Iram\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nateyairam84@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMs. Irum Shahzadi\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nIrum.khan56789@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMr. Muhammad Adil\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nmadilkhancui@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMr. Hafiz Faisal Abdullah\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nfaisal.fuuastofficial@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMs. Noor Nayyer\nMS(IS)\nLecturer\n✉\nnoornayyer189@gmail.com\nView Profile\nMr. Muhammad Aqib Rauf\nMS(CS)\nLecturer\n✉\nkhawajaaqib27 @gmail.com\nView Profile\nMr. Syed Rizwan Gilani\nMS(EE)\nLab Engineer\n✉\nrizwangilani@fuuastisb.edu.pk\nView Profile\nMr. Faheem Ahmed\nMS(EE)\nLab Engineer\n✉\nengr_faheem@fuuastisb.edu.pk\nView Profile\nMr. Kashif Aziz\nMS(EE)\nLab Engineer\n✉\nkashifaziz@fuuastisb.edu.pk\nView Profile\nFederal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology\nKuri Road Islamabad, 45570, Pakistan\nOffice# +92-9252861-64\nCopyright ©\n2024 \n            , designed & developed by\nIT Department\n\n--- FUUAST Islamabad ---\nFUUAST Islamabad\nannouncements\nJournals\nSCHOLARSHIP\nmedia\nLogin\nHome\nPrograms\nGraduate\nUndergraduate\nFaculities\nArts\nDepartment of English\nDepartment of International Relations\nDepartment of Mass Communication\nDepartment of Urdu\nBusiness Administration, Commerce & Economics\nDepartment of Business Administration\nDepartment of Commerce\nDepartment of Economics\nEngineering\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\nMa'arif-e-Islamia\nDepartment of Islamic Studies\nScience & Technology\nDepartment of Physics\nDepartment of Computer Science\nDepartment of Mathematics\nDepartment of Sofware Engineering\nDepartment of Statistics\nStudents\nDigital Library\nExamination\nExamination\nDegree Clearance\nResults\nStatus Reports\nLaptop Scheme\nORIC\nUniversity Card\nDownload Forms\nAdmission\nApply Now\nMerit Lists\nAdministration\nAccounts\nFee Section\nAcademics\nAdmission Department\nIT Department\nIT Cell\nMIS Cell\nPlanning & Development\nSecurity\nStore & Purchase\nTransport Section\nDownload Forms\nContact Us\nRegister\n×\nSIGN UP\nLogin\n×\nLOGIN\nMr. Ch.
